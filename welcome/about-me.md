# About me

Let me take you on a journey through my diverse background and experiences that have led me to where I am today.

**My Journey**

My professional journey might surprise you. I began my career as a Biomedical Engineer, specializing in installing and servicing complex medical equipment like MRIs, CT Scanners, and X-rays. For over a decade, I honed my skills in a highly regulated industry, where precision and attention to detail were paramount.

In 2016, an entrepreneurial spirit awakened within me. I co-founded a hostel in my hometown of San Jos√©, Costa Rica. This venture ignited my curiosity for technology, as we needed a website but couldn't afford the high costs of development. Determined to find a solution, I delved into web development, learned to use no-code tools, SEO, and digital marketing, and discovered the power of innovation.

It was in this hostel that I fell into the crypto rabbithole. Being exposed to many digital nomads one of them was kind enough to explain crypto to me. I had already known about bitcoin, but it wasn't until a specific conversation on 2017 that I fell into the crypto rabbithole. For the first couple of years I only bought coins and dreamt about becoming rich overnight, but that wasn't the case.&#x20;

I kept exploring how to break into tech and startups, this led me to apply to Y Combinator's Startup School in 2018. My project was only an idea, but I was exposed to top minds entrepreneurship. My fascination with growth and product management grew from this experience.

In 2019, I made a pivotal decision. I left my career in medical equipment to dive into the digital world. I took on the challenge of crafting a digital strategy for a beachfront hostel, only to face unforeseen challenges due to the global pandemic. We also had to shut the hostel down :(.&#x20;

**Embracing Blockchain and Crypto**

Amid uncertainty, I accepted a role at a friend's cloud computing startup as a project manager. This was a bootstraped startup so I had to wear many hats at once. But I never took my attention away from blockchain and crypto. I was obsessed.&#x20;

In contrast to many in the industry, I started with enterprise blockchain technologies, specifically Corda, developed by R3. I was probably one of the first Certified Corda Developers in Latam, even though I was not a developer, I took the certification as a curiosity of how it worked. I became a Corda Mentor for startups and was later appointed as a Crypto Product Manager for a prominent startup in Costa Rica (250+ company).

In this startup I led an OTC product, but right before we launched the startup had financial issues and shut down. While this was a huge blow to many, I am grateful for those days. This got me to lead a full product from scratch, dealing with partners, stakeholders, users, marketing, customer service, a trading desk, and more. I got to understand how a fintech works under the hood.&#x20;

The next company I joined was BeInCrypto.com, a fully remote company Crypto News media. I got to work with the R\&D dev team developing a learning academy focused on crypto. We delivered an MVP that used NFTs as enrollment mechanisms and as Badges. I also got to interview some of the brightest minds in the industry as a POC for the academy. Because of market conditions they shut down my product. And this is how Tech Rebel was born.

**Tech Rebel: Pioneering the Future**

With the networking I built participating in hackathons in Argentina and my experience as an early stage Product Manager, I founded Tech Rebel, a product agency dedicated to helping companies experiment with blockchain and crypto. We've developed a unique framework for discovery, definition, and scoping of POCs and MVPs. We specialize in turning bold ideas into well-defined, actionable strategies, ensuring a robust groundwork for successful development.

From Tech Rebel, two products (spin-offs?) have won awards and continue on their journey towards Product Market Fit: \

Veritrust.

Thank you for joining me on this journey of transformation, exploration, and innovation. Together, let's explore the limitless possibilities of technology.
