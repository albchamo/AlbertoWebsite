VeriTrust is a blockchain-based procurement solution designed for both public and private sectors. Using the Ethereum blockchain, VeriTrust aims to significantly reduce corruption in procurement, which can account for 20-30% of national budgets. Our solution is focused on enhancing transparency, efficiency, and security in procurement processes.

### **Problem Statement and Solutions**

We all know corruption is a big issue, and one of the main facilitators of it is the lack of transparency. Both public and private sectors suffer from this, which is why Veritrust has a solution for both:&#x20;

1. **Public Sector Challenges:** Issues of transparency, security, and inclusivity, leading to corruption and inefficiency.
   * **Solution:** A transparent, secure, and inclusive open-source blockchain protocol for public procurement processes.
2. **Private Sector Challenges:** Complexities and varying compliance requirements in procurement, lack of trust of/from providers, particularly for remote and decentralized companies.
   * **Solution:** A customizable, blockchain-based platform enhancing transparency, efficiency, and security for private companies.

This is an open-source protocol. What it does is create a Smart contract for each new tender process and this Smart Contract is what deals with the information flow of each process (explained below). For the public sector, they can build on the open source and pay a new tender fee (deploy SC) and each bidder also pays a smaller fee. For the private sector we offer a licensing fee (X amount of tenders per year) and Integration fees.
