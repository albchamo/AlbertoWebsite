# NeoBank Discovery

**Challenge:** Our client aimed to upgrade from a manual crypto OTC solution to an automated platform to improve services for existing customers. They needed to understand the development efforts required and find the most optimal route for creating this solution, considering technical, competitive, and market landscapes.

**Solution:** Tech Rebel conducted an in-depth discovery and strategic planning process, culminating in a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD). This PRD outlined user personas, competitive analysis, value propositions, and a business model canvas, paving the way for a user-centric OTC crypto platform that simplifies transactions while addressing market needs.

**Outcome:** The PRD enabled Galileo to precisely scope the required features and technology partners for their new platform, offering insights into the competitive landscape and market demands. This foundational work laid the groundwork for an OTC crypto platform that not only improves service for current customers but also positions Galileo as a leader in crypto financial services.
