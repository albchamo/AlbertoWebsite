# RWA Tokenization POC: Cars

We are very proud of our recent collaboration with Brashlabs. Brashlabs approached Tech Rebel with a groundbreaking idea: to develop a Proof of Concept (POC) using the XRP ledger to trace vehicle history, a concept with potential applications across various industries.&#x20;

The objective was clear – create a working POC that could demonstrate to potential investors the feasibility and innovation of their idea.

The XRP ledger, known for its efficiency, scalability, and particularly its regulatory clarity post-Ripple SEC case, has been on my professional bucket list. It is actually the first asset I bought and what really got me into crypto. Unlike many blockchain platforms that require complex smart contracts for tokenization, the XRP ledger offers native support for issuing tokens. They recently added NFTs, so I was eager to dive deep into it.

We began with a deep dive into the project's requirements and objectives, developing a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) that became the project's blueprint. This was a POC, where the main objective is not to go to market, but to build the first iteration of the concept.

Our steps included:

* **Market and Research**: Understand the landscape of car traceability apps and what information is important. Find documentation on the XRP Ledger, understand libraries, the ecosystem, etc.
* **Strategic Conceptualization**: Craft a value proposition aligning with Brashlabs' vision and outlining a viable business model. Prune out all features that are not required for this POC.
* **Documentation and Planning**: Create detailed diagrams, user flows, wireframes, schemas, and a conceptualization of the POC, ensuring every aspect was meticulously planned and documented.
* **UI for POC**: Use public design systems to design the look and feel of this POC, so it can be shown as a demo to investors.

This approach allowed us to provide a clear, structured, dev-ready product for the development team, ensuring a cohesive understanding of the project’s goals and technical requirements.

#### Finding the Perfect Development Team

At Tech Rebel, we have been building a network of development partners around Latin America. We focus on finding great self-managed development teams. What we value most in these teams is their ability to receive a well-documented project like ours, ask questions, provide feedback, and get to work. We don't want to micromanage or deal with staffing.

For this product, we sent the documentation to five teams that we knew had experience with RWAs. The Art Universe, a very experienced team of developers, was chosen because of their expertise and similar projects in their portfolio.

#### The Outcome: A Cost-Effective, Efficient POC Development

The collaboration between Tech Rebel, Brashlabs, and The Art Universe led to the development of a pioneering, on-chain blockchain POC within a remarkably short timeframe and at a fraction of the expected cost. Our precise documentation and detailed PRD allowed the development team to accurately estimate resources, leading to an efficient and streamlined development process.

The successful completion of this POC has not only validated Brashlabs' concept but has also opened doors to potential investors. The project received significant interest from industry players, with letters of intent already in discussion for future development and collaboration.

Tech Rebel's involvement in this project underscores our commitment to bringing web3 innovations to life. By focusing on thorough planning, detailed documentation, and a deep understanding of blockchain technology, we help businesses like Brashlabs navigate the complexities of web3 and blockchain, transforming bold ideas into tangible, market-ready products.
